# Rhyme Know Reason Programming Training Homework Template

## Procedure for creating weekly homework

1. Make a copy of this repository named `homework_week_x_template`.
2. Change `rootProject.name` in `settings.gradle` and sync Gradle.
2. Add the necessary classes (both in main and test).
3. Remember to create run configurations with the `share` option checked. There's already one to run the tests.
4. Explain exactly what is expected in the README.md file.
5. Remove the existing Git remote. You don't want to push your changes to the base template.
5. Upload to GitHub (create a blank repo in the RKR organization, add it as a remote, and push to it). Make sure you commit all of the not-ignored files in the `.idea` directory.
